The process of completing homework:
1. A profile was created for a basic homework using html, css and a jpg format avatar.
2. Static files (.html, .css) were served by backend app.py using send_static_file() function. 
3. Frontend part can be viewed via Github Pages on https://ilyazanin01.github.io, for this index.html file has been created.
4. For advanced part the same profile has been used. But it is located in templates and serving via render_template() function (added timestamp as rendered parameter).
5. Also for advanced part app.py was modified. The modified version is called advanced_app.py and located in the root of repo.
